# Project Enhancement Network & Incubator (PEN & Inc)

Project Enhancement Network & Incubator (PEN & Inc) is a digital research project accelerator. PEN & Inc is a structured 7-week program for members of the FSU community who are looking to take a digital research project from an idea to implementation. This is a cohort-based program, where participants work together to craft their ideas. In addition to incubating projects, PEN & Inc is designed to act as a hub, connecting researchers to each other in a trans-disciplinary space, so that they can openly share ideas, resources, and techniques.

## Learning Objectives

* Succinctly articulate the purpose of your project. What is the need in your field that it meets? Why should your university, discipline, or scholarly community care about the project?
* Understand what resources are available to you on FSU's campus. Who are your potential collaborators? Who could provide support for your project?
* Determine which tools and methods are best suited for your project. Understand the role of tools and platforms in the outcome of your project.
* Understand and be able to address the risks involved in starting your project.
* Articulate what happens with your project once you are done working on it. Will the project be preserved or maintained? Will it be continued by other scholars in your field? Who will be responsible for the project once you are done working on it?

The Incubator will consist of 7 discussion-based sessions. Participants will be expected to participate in discussions both during these sessions and outside of the Incubator on Canvas's discussion platform. Participants will also be asked to write a few short documents (such as a project proposal and a grant application narrative), and comment on the work of colleagues.

## Schedule

### Week 1: Proposal Development

**Outcomes:** Create the first draft of your project proposal (during the first session). This will be edited throughout the semester. The goal of creating a project proposal is to develop a succinct and lucid description of your project, its possible users, and its contribution to the field. Ultimately, you should be able to talk about your project in a way that piques the interest of potential collaborators, users, and supporters. Ultimately, the finalized proposal will be presented to the FSU Libraries' Project Review Team.

**Readings:**

* Stewart Varner - [Project Charter](https://stewartvarner.com/2014/05/06/project-charter/)
* Brian Croxall - [12 Basic Principles of Project Management](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/12-basic-principles-of-project-management/31421)
* Bethany Nowviskie - [10 Rules for Humanities Scholars New to Project Management](http://nowviskie.org/handouts/DH/10rules.pdf)

### Week 2: Risk Assessment

**Outcomes:** In this unit, you will be learning about and identifying possible setbacks you may experience as you go through the process of project development and implementation. These setbacks may be related to copyright, redundancy of projects, difficulty of publication, your career, etc. You should identify three potential roadblocks you may encounter as you work on your project. You should also come up with ways in which you may address these setbacks or change your course of action.

**Readings:**

* James Baker - [Preserving Your Research Data](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/preserving-your-research-data)
* Adam Crymble - [Does your historical collection need a database-driven website?](http://digitalhumanities.org:8081/dhq/vol/9/1/000206/000206.html)
* [Digital Copyright Slider](http://librarycopyright.net/resources/digitalslider/)
* Columbia University - [Copyright Basics](https://copyright.columbia.edu/basics.html)

### Week 3: Data, Tools, and Infrastructure

**Outcomes:** This week you will determine the tools, applications, metadata schemas, or languages you will need in order to complete your project. You should come out of this week's session with a sense of the infrastructure required for your project and the skills you will need to cultivate.


In addition to determining the tools you will be working with, you will also be figuring out your method. You should come out of this session with a clear statement of the method you're using, as well as a knowledge of other projects that are employing this method in their research.

**Readings:**

* Pick one “[How did they make that](http://dhcommons.org/journal/issue-1)” from DH Commons
* Explore the [DiRT Directory](http://dirtdirectory.org/)
* Explore the [Periodic Table of Digital Research Tools](http://scalar.usc.edu/works/digital-research-resources/index)

### Week 4: Collaborative Partnerships

**Outcomes:** For this week, you should be able to articulate who your collaborators are. You will generate a list of possible collaborators, their roles, and how you plan to credit them for their work.

**Readings:** (For this week, you will be collaboratively annotating your readings with hypothes.is. Please make sure you have an account set up at https://hypothes.is/ and have at least 2 of the readings annotated)

* John Bradley - “No Job for Techies: Technical Contributions to Research in the Digital Humanities” 
* Anderson et al. - [Student Labour and Training in the Digital Humanities](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/10/1/000233/000233.html) 
* Explore the [Networked Knowledge](http://personal.psu.edu/amm81/sci/) whitepaper

### Week 5: Grant Funding and Other Support

**Outcomes:** Understand the basic parts of a grant proposal and the resources you will need in order to write one. Gain knowledge of who on campus you should contact and consult with when you begin the process of grant writing.

Determine if your project even needs funding. Is your project sustainable without it? If so, what free resources are there on campus that you can use? If not, what are two grants that you could apply for?

**Readings:**

* Look through the NEH's [Startup Grant](http://www.neh.gov/files/grants/digital-humanities-start-sept-16-2015.pdf) Guidelines
* Sheila Brennan - [Let the Grant do the Talking](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-4/let-the-grant-do-the-talking-by-sheila-brennan/)

### Week 6: Proof of Concepts

**Outcomes:** For this week, you will create a small proof of concept, based on the tools you identified in week 3. Proof of concepts could be:
* creation of small data sets
* wireframing
* population of content management system (like Omeka or Wordpress)
* creation of metadata schema/requirements

**To do before this session:**
* Install all necessary software or packages
* Test out the platform to see if there’s anything you don’t understand (please come with a list of questions or concerns to ask Sarah)
