## Overview

### Briefly summarize your project and its goals:

### What is/are the product(s) of this project? (e.g. a website with a blog? a set of interactive maps? visualizations? a dataset?

### Are there any materials that need to be digitized? If so, what type of material and how many pages?

*Please contact Special Collections and Archives and the Digital Library Center if you have materials that need to be digitized.*

## Users

### Who are the primary users for this project? (faculty? students? the general public?)

### Please provide at least one “user story” for the output for your project. This is a way of articulating what a user would do with your project. It is often easiest to state these in the form of “I am a [role] and I want to [action].”

*For example, you may say:*

*“I am a faculty researcher studying Margaret Cavendish, and I want to be able to view relationships between different 17th century scientists. I want to be able to search for Cavendish, and find a list of her works, a timeline of her publications, and a list of associated scientists. I then want to be able to click on associated scientists to see their publications and timeline. I also want to view a network visualization of relationships.”*

### How does this project contribute to your field?

## Pre-work

### What efforts have you made to ensure that this project isn’t duplicating an existing work?

### Is there pre-existing data or metadata for the project? If yes, how will it be collected, stored, and harvested? If not, how do you intend to collect the metadata? (please specify data standards and formats)

*For example:*

*“I have scans of texts and  transcriptions in .txt files, but I want to mark them up for publication. I plan to hand encode these files and preserve them in GitHub. The metadata will be captured using the TEI standards.”*

*Note: if you do not know what to put here, please schedule a consultation with Sarah Stanley (scstanley@fsu.edu).*

### What tools do you plan to use for this project? What infrastructure do these tools require?

*For example:*

*I will need mapping software and a platform for publishing those maps. I will also need platform for displaying jpeg images and transcriptions of text that were done in HTML.*

## Collaborators

### Who will be collaborating with you on this project? Please specify names and roles. If there is a role that has yet to be filled, please indicate how you anticipate filling this role.

## Funding

### Have you already secured funding from any source. If so, from whom?

### Do you intend to apply for funding for this project? Which funding sources are you currently considering?

*The Office of Digital Research and Scholarship strongly advises project leads who wish to acquire funding to schedule a meeting with the Office of Proposal Development*

## Completion

### Is there a specific deadline for this project? When do you hope to start?

### What is the timeline for completion for this project?

### How much time do you plan to invest in this project? How much time do you anticipate others will need to invest? Are you taking any measures to free up your schedule for active project work?

### What are your plans for storage, access, and preservation, once this project is completed? What are your plans for the project once you are no longer working on it?
