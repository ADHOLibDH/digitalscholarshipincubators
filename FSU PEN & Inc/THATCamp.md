# PEN & Inc - Project Enhancement Network & Incubator

*Proposed as a session for [THATCamp Florida, 2016](http://bit.ly/FSULIBincubator).*

*The idea for a Digital Projects Incubator is licensed CC0 to anyone, anywhere, ever, because #openaccess.*

The following are notes from the 2016 THATCamp FL session on Digital Project Incubators.

**Leading questions:**

* What are the characteristics of a digital projects incubator?
  * tech sandbox - include training on use of tools?
  * mentor network beyond the institution (FLDH?)
  * survey (UCF focused on College of Arts)
  * access to resources that an individual/group might not have
  * cohort connection
  * people in the community can propose a problem to solve
  * the model is important
* Organizationally, who could/should be connected to something like this?
  * connections to departments
  * Deans, Office of Research
  * university general counsel or technology licensing (whoever does patents)
  * library/scholarly communications (whoever does copyright counsel)
  * human relations folks (who can talk on processes for writing job descriptions, mentoring procedures, dealing with personnel conflicts, etc.)
  * public relations for the university, or public interest communication folks in journalism (whoever can talk about project pitches, public engagement, etc.)
  * Maybe the McNair/RAMP Program- have undergraduate researchers who work with a faculty 
  * Honors in the Major or Honors College- Maybe have a workshop and connect with other students willing to use their research and convert it to a digital project
  * Professors who are willing to have student to propose their ideas as a project in class → Get exposure and get the word out 
  * Students proposing fieldwork projects that might be represented digitally 
  * FLDH.org
  * interdisciplinary working groups that might be places to incubate projects that last beyond the period of a single student’s presence at a university
  * Libraries/IT (when programming capacity beyond participants needed)
  * Florida ExpertNet seems like it could somehow be harnessed or roped in
* How would a program like this be structured?
* What models of tech incubators are useful to refer to?
* How does this complicate research processes/agendas?
  * seed $$ program
  * faculty fellowship - $5,000 is normal to hire a grad student/adjunct faculty to teach a course and get a “course release” for an incubator fellow. (UF Examples: [team-teaching in the humanities grant](http://www.humanities.ufl.edu/proposals.html), [Creative Campus Scholar in Residence Grant](https://creativecampus.ufl.edu/))
  * grassroots campaigns to expand tenure/promotion criteria...or at least some link to an evaluation/peer review system
* Can an academic research project incubator function with(out) commercial product development goals?
  * (opinion: as an “incubator,” no, but as a project development cycle absolutely!)
    * As Incubator, the goal might be application for larger research grant using ‘proof of concept’ that is incubated in the org, rather than commercial product. 
  * what we sell is a service, not necessarily a product
  * there may be allies in business who work with “social entrepreneurship” initiatives
  * What are the deliverables?
    * Broader impact and community engagement
    * free app
    * website
    
**Incubator Program**
(“Modules”?)
* Week 0 - proposal review/screening
* Week 1 - Ideation/Proposal Development
* Week 2- Risk Management
* Week 3 - Infrastructure (including project management development)
* Week 4 - Partnerships
* Week 5 - Funding
* Week ?? - Sustainability/Digital Preservation
* Week 6 - Prototyping/Proof of Concept
* Week 6.5 - Proto Peer Review (sending out of project to others….generating letters for a tenure/promotion portfolio...or at least identification of appropriate review procedure for later in the project development)
* Week 7 - Next Steps → How to articulate your product to the general public or audience

**Incubator Outcomes**
* The DSC/O (digital scholarship center/office) either a) commits to accomplishing some portion of the project, or b) is able to effectively consult with and direct the project to necessary resources for its next phase.
* The project team/leader gains valuable knowledge on how projects are developed, builds a concise project proposal and pitch, and is connected to a larger network of researchers and research support at their institution.
