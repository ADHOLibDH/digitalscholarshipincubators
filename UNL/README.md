## Description of UNL Libraries' DSI
The Digital Scholarship Incubator (DSI) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) Libraries is a competitive fellowship program that promotes student-led digital research and scholarship at UNL. The DSI is open to UNL graduate students in the humanities, social sciences, and human sciences, including those enrolled in master's, doctoral, and certificate programs. DSI fellows commit to developing a contribution to scholarship that depends on digital methodologies for research and/or publication. They receive stipends to allow them to focus on their scholarship for the twelve-week fellowship period, and they are eligible for additional professional development funding. Fellows agree to develop their projects in a collaborative, co-working environment and to be present in the DSI's co-working space for a minimum of 15 hours per week, at times that significantly overlap with one another. While concentrating on their own scholarship, DSI fellows also support the research of other fellows through thoughtful dialogue, critical engagement, and knowledge exchange. Fellows are responsible for all of the development work on their projectsâ€”both development of the disciplinary idea/knowledge and technical development. To prepare fellows for and support them in this work, the DSI provides research consultations; project coaching and support; resources, including hardware, software, people, and materials; collaborative work space; and professionalizing opportunities.

## Materials included
Included in this folder are three years' worth of funding proposals--including justification and budgets--and calls for proposals for the first three years of the DSI (2014, 2015, 2016). Also included is a student proposal from 2016, in order to give a sense of what the proposal process looks like from the student perspective. All documents are made available in both PDF and Markdown files.
