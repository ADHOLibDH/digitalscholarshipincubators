# Curriculum
## Background 
To date, the DSI curriculum and experience have evolved each year on a week-by-week basis, in response to student needs. Throughout the fellowship period students meet with experts in and outside the UNL Libraries in areas such as data curation and scholarly communication, as well as with librarians in their disciplinary areas. 

## Toward more of a curriculum
Beginning in 2016, students started week 1 by thinking about and responding to the questions below. Throughout the next 11 weeks of the DSI, we returned to these questions--sometimes directly, sometimes indirectly--to provide grounding for the dispositions and skills the DSI seeks to develop.
* What is the primary (humanities) research question you are exploring?
* What is your "data"?
* What is the theoretical framework and/or system of values that you are bringing to the project?
* What is your method (at this stage)?
* What are the scholarly contexts of your work?
* How will you manage the scholarly contexts of your work?
* What is your minimum viable product?
* What is your timeline for your minimum viable product?
* How and when will you communicate about your project?

## Looking ahead
